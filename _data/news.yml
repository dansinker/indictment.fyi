  yesterday: On March 30th, former president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/30/trump-ny-indictment/">Donald Trump was indicted</a> by a Manhattan grand jury impaneled by New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Until today, however, we haven't known the specifics of the charges against him. Now we do...
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Donald Trump has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records</b>, marking the first time a US president has ever been charged with a crime. The large number of charges is due to each business record—we're talking check stubs, invoices, and accounting ledger entries—receiving its own count. The business records date back to 2017 and appear to all relate to the $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels by Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen and his subsequent reimbursement by the Trump Organization. The counts are nearly identical, each alleging that the records were falsified with "intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof." This part is crucial, because falsifying business records is only a misdemeanor in New York. To qualify as a felony, the falsifying needs to have been done in service of committing or concealing another crime. More on that in a second.

  - item: <b>Accompanying the charges was a Statement of Fact that built a larger narrative around the case than the narrow charges offered</b>. In it, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg outlined a "scheme" Trump hatched "with others," including Michael Cohen and former American Media Inc CEO David Pecker, to purchase "negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the Defendant's electoral prospects." Bragg cited hush money payments made not only to Stormy Daniels, but also to a Trump Tower doorman and another woman. While the Statement of Fact outlines what amounts to a conspiracy between Trump, Cohen, Pecker, and others, it is important to note that conspiracy was not charged today, only falsifying business records.

  - item: So OK that's all good, but no conspiracy was charged and falsifying business records on its own isn't a felony, <b>so what <i>were</i> the crimes that these business records were falsified to conceal?</b> At a press conference this afternoon, DA Bragg explained that, while the law does not require the charges to include that information, <b>the potential crimes include violations of New York State election law, which Bragg said "makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means," making false statements in misrepresenting things like the reimbursement of Michael Cohen to tax authorities as legal expenses, and breaking federal election law, which limits the total amount that can be donated to a campaign.</b>

  - item: The charges were unsealed as part of <b>Trump's Big Day at the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, where he was arrested, booked, and fingerprinted on the 7th floor (no mugshot was taken, sorry) and then arraigned in the courtroom of state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan on the 15th floor</b>, where he plead not guilty to the 34 counts against him. Cameras were everywhere, following by air as his motorcade left Trump Tower and drove down Manhattan, perched on street corners as the entourage drove by, waiting in the hallway of the 15th floor—framed on a set of black double doors that Trump eventually walked through, looking dour, before entering the courtroom—and waiting from a distance at LaGuardia for Trump's quick exit from New York after the arraignment wrapped. Before the whole whirlwind began, en route to the Criminal Courts Building, Trump posted to Truth Social that it was "SURREAL" and, honestly, it really was.

CNN cut away after 40 minutes and I took that as my cue to jet as well. It had been a long day.

  - item: So what now? Mostly, we wait. Despite the high-profile nature of the defendant, this <i>is</i> a criminal trial in the New York court system and things will move at a very deliberate pace. <b>The next procedural hearing is scheduled for December 4th</b>—yes, you read that right—and, if the case is not dismissed at that hearing (which Trump's attorneys are certain to request) a trial won't happen until sometime next year. <b>In the near term, the next thing that will happen is the discovery phase</b>, where prosecutors will turn over the evidence they have amassed to the defense. After that point, which might take a month or two, Merchan says he will decide on a trial date.

  yesterday: Last week former president Donald Trump became <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/30/trump-ny-indictment/">the first US president to be indicted for a crime</a>. The indictment is sealed until tomorrow's arraignment, but it is believed to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/21/trump-stormy-payments/">pertain to hush-money payments</a> made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016 and the potential falsifying of business records connected to the payment. 
  todays: 
  - item: Well, he didn't flee. <b>Donald Trump arrived in New York this afternoon</b> after departing Mar-a-Lago in an 11-car entourage that was followed to the airport by news helicopters, OJ-Bronco-style. He was accompanied on the flight by more than a dozen aides as well as his son Eric. Trump arrived at a heavily-secured Trump Tower around 4:30 Eastern, where he waved at the assembled press and a crowd of his supporters before entering the building, where he'll be staying the night before his big day tomorrow.

However, mugshots are no longer public record in New York, so we'll likely only see it if it's leaked or if the Trump team releases it. But if we do see the mugshot, former White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Time, "it will be the most manly, most masculine, most handsome mug shot of all time." I just... <i>vomits everywhere.</i>

This will be the moment that most everyone has been waiting for, where we will learn the charges against the former president and the scope of the case DA Bragg has built against him. At that point, Trump will enter a plea—his lawyers have insisted it will be not guilty.

  - item: Tuesday, April 4, is shaping up to be a very big day. First up, <b>it's being reported that Tuesday will be the day that Donald Trump will be arrested</b>. Appearing on the TODAY show this morning, Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopino said emphatically that Trump would turn himself in to authorities and that he was "not going to hole up in Mar-a-Lago." The current belief is that Trump will fly into New York on Monday and stay the night at Trump Tower before heading to the Manhattan DA's office in the morning to turn himself in, at which point he will be booked, fingerprinted, and photographed. (Yes, if there's a mugshot, <i>of course</i> it'll be included in the update, <i>I mean come on</i>.)

The Secret Service is expected to have a significant presence in and around the courtroom and an advance team toured the court complex today. The arraignment is where we will finally hear the charges against Trump. After hearing the charges, Trump will be asked how he pleas and Tacopino told TODAY that there is "zero, ZE-RO" chance that Trump will plead guilty. "It's not gonna happen."

Weisselberg is currently wrapping up his five-month prison sentence and is due to be released in mid-April.

  tomorrow: All attention turns to Tuesday, April 4, when Donald Trump will be arrested, booked, and arraigned. Of course, that date might change, it's all still being negotiated. 

- date: 2023-03-30T16:10:00
  yesterday: Let's catch you up on 16 years real quick. In 2006, then-reality TV star Donald Trump met adult film star Stormy Daniels <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/who-is-stormy-daniels-what-did-she-say-happened-with-trump-2023-03-30/">at a celebrity golf tournament</a> where Daniels slept with Trump in what she would later call "<a href="https://people.com/politics/stormy-daniels-book-donald-trump-least-impressive-sex/">the least impressive sex I ever had</a>." Flash forward to 2016, Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president and Stormy Daniels is shopping her story to tabloids, but instead it's bought, for $130,000, in a hush-money purchase facilitated by Trump's lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen himself took out a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/politics/michael-cohen-trump-organization-email-stormy-daniels/index.html">home equity line of credit</a> to cover the payment, wired to Daniels 10 days before the 2016 Presidential election and was later paid back over numerous installments by the Trump Organization. Flash forward to 2018, when <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-crime-d6dbb8b02a4446f6800de794b45523e6">Michael Cohen is arrested</a> for tax evasion, lying to investigators about Trump's businesses in Russia and—most important for this moment in time—violating campaign finance laws for that $130,000 payment to Daniels, which federal prosecutors argued was a illegal contribution to Trump's campaign. Cohen later plead guilty, meaning that the case was never taken to trial, and served a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-crime-new-york-manhattan-campaigns-3a0413202e80ab99c9f6377f97d07c04">three year sentence</a>, most of which was spent in home confinement due to the pandemic. Almost immediately after Cohen's guilty plea, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance began to investigate the hush-money payments at the state level, eventually widening the scope to include the Trump Organization's business practices. Vance's investigations eventually lead to the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html">Trump Organization being found guilty</a> of tax fraud and falsifying business records. His investigation of the Daniels payments, however, seemed fade into the background and, eventually, when new Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg took over in January 2022, it was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/17/alvin-bragg-stormy-daniels-trump/">reported to be a "zombie" case</a> that most presumed to all but dead. That is until January of this year when Bragg convened a new grand jury to once again investigate the payment of hush money to Daniels, which brings us to today...
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury. He becomes the first president in US history to ever be charged with a crime.</b> According to the Washington Post, "the indictment was filed behind closed doors at the Lower Manhattan courthouse after the clerk’s office was closed for the day," and comes about two months after Bragg impaneled a grand jury to investigate the circumstances around the 2016 payment by Trump to adult star Stormy Daniels which previously lead to the 2018 conviction of his former lawyer Michael Cohen. There's a <i>long</i> way to go from here, but this moment is truly unprecedented.

  - item: So what are the charges? As of now we don't know. <b>Grand jury proceedings are secret and the indictment is sealed until a judge unseals it at an arraignment. What we <i>do</i> know is that the charges will almost certainly focus on the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels and the falsifying of business records that came afterwards.</b> Now, paying hush money isn't illegal, and falsifying business records is usually a misdemeanor offense, and this seems like it would be <i>a whole lot of effort</i> if that's where it stopped. But the real question is whether or not those business records were falsified to conceal another crime, like, say, campaign finance violations, at which point the crime could be prosecuted as a felony offense. According to the Wall Street Journal, "any successful prosecution would likely require evidence establishing that Mr. Trump tried to hide the repayment to Mr. Cohen with false book entries" and that those entries were made with an "intent to defraud." Of course, we'll know much more soon.

  - item: <b>Negotiations are already underway to facilitate the arrest of Donald Trump.</b> According to Politico, the "Manhattan district attorney’s office asked for Donald Trump to surrender on Friday," but Trump's team turned them down, claiming that the Secret Service "needed more time to prepare." While it's not expected that Trump will resist arrest (<i>can you imagine???</i>), Florida Governor Ron DeSantis did Tweet that law enforcement would "not assist in an extradition request." It likely won't come to that, however, and the current expectation is that Trump will surrender next week, possibly Tuesday.

  - item: Now it's important to remember that there's a <i>long</i> way between an indictment and a conviction, and that a conviction of Donald Trump is by no means guaranteed. One thing that <i>is</i> guaranteed is, barring a guilty plea by Trump (which, <i>stares</i>), this process will be brutally slow. According Reuters, <b>the "average criminal case in New York takes more than a year to move from indictment to trial" and this case is anything but average.</b> Which could mean that <i>if</i> a trial happens at all it could happen during the last months of the 2024 presidential race or, very possibly, after. So that means these updates could stretch... <i>cries</i>

  tomorrow: At some point in the next week Donald Trump will be arrested and processed (complete with mug shot and fingerprints). Shortly after his arrest, he will have an arraignment hearing at which point we'll know the charges against him and he will plead guilty or not guilty (guess which) and then the legal maneuvering will truly begin.
