  yesterday: In November of 2020 Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html">lost his reelection campaign</a>. He refused to accept those results and, well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">things happened</a>. Do I really have to rehash all this? We've been living in its shadow ever since. Anyway, that brings us to today....
  todays: 
  - item: <b>For the third time this year, Donald Trump has been indicted</b>. This time around it's on federal charges stemming from his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election and the shenanigans that he and six co-conspirators (more on them in a second) got up to trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power. <b>The indictment handed down from a grand jury in Washington DC today includes charges on four counts&#x3a; Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy against Rights</b>. After revelations from the impeachment of Trump in January 2020 and the two years of the House's investigations into January 6 that ended when Republicans took control of the House this year, there's nothing particularly <i>new</i> about what's in the 45-page indictment, but seeing it all laid out in paintext is really something.

  - item: The conspiracies alleged in the charges focus on two major areas (the third "Conspiracy against Rights," is more about the overall scheme denying voters their right to have their votes count). Let's look at them&#x3a;

  - item: First is <b>a conspiracy to block the election results by pressuring state legislators and officials to reject or overturn the results of the election in their states and by recruiting slates of false electors to "force a conflict" come time to certify those electors</b>. All of this, the indictment alleges (and goes to great pains to document), was based on "knowingly false" information.

  - item: <b>The second conspiracy was around attempting to stop the final certification of electoral votes on January 6 by pressuring Mike Pence, who oversaw the proceedings as the ceremonial president of the Senate, to reject the results</b>. When, famously, Pence refused, Trump and his conspirators pushed forward with attempting to block the proceedings in other ways and, well, you know what happened at the Capitol on January 6.

  - item: Of course, you can't have a conspiracy alone and this indictment lists six other folks who plotted alongside Trump. <b>While unnamed (and as-yet uncharged) the Co-Conspirators are easily identifiable based on quotes in the indictment</b>. The Washington Post, handily, has already sorted out who five of the six are&#x3a;<ul><li><b>Co-Conspirator 1&#x3a; Rudy Giuliani</b>, who promised a "trial by combat" at the rally on January 6 and was "willing to pursue strategies the Defendant's 2020 re-election campaign attorneys would not." </li><li><b>Co-Conspirator 2&#x3a; John Eastman</b>, "an attorney who devised and attempted to implement a strategy to leverage the Vice President's ceremonial role overseeing the certification proceeding to obstruct the certification of the presidential election." </li><li><b>Co-Conspirator 3&#x3a; Sidney Powell</b>, "whose unfounded claims of election fraud the Defendant privately acknowledged to others sounded 'crazy.'"</li><li><b>Co-Conspirator 4&#x3a; Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark</b>, who worked with Trump to "use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud."</li><li><b>Co-Conspirator 5&#x3a; Kenneth Chesebro</b>, "an attorney who assisted in devising and attempting to implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding."</li><li><b>Co-Conspirator 6&#x3a; A political consultant,</b> "who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding."</li></ul> While currently uncharged, it's entirely possible more charges are coming against some of these folks.

Trump, of course, said these are "fake charges," and his attorney John Lauro promised "We now have the ability in this case to issue our own subpoenas, and <b>we will re-litigate every single issue in the 2020 election</b>." <i>Kill me.</i>

In the next few days, Trump will appear in court to hear the charges against him and to plead guilty or not guilty (gee, I wonder...) and eventually—likely in the coming weeks—we'll get a trial date that will join an already-crowded calendar (remember he's already got criminal trials scheduled for March and May next year). Oh and also there's a whole Republican primary calendar and, if he wins the nomination, a national election he's running in.

  tomorrow: Don't forget that there's a very possible indictment still to drop from Fulton County Georgia DA Fani Willis around Trump and his cronies attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia. It's expected in the next week or two. 
- date: 2023-07-27T17:30:00
  yesterday: On March 30, 2023, Donald Trump became the first US president to be indicted for crimes, when he was <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23741583-the-people-of-the-state-of-new-york-v-donald-j-trump">charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in New York</a> for falsifying business records connected to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. A few months later, he became the first US president to be indicted <i>twice</i> when <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23839625-trump-indictment">the US Justice Department charged him with 37 federal counts</a> stemming from his refusal to turn over classified documents after his presidency. Both of those indictments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/nyregion/trump-trial-date.html">are now</a> headed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/21/trump-trial-date-classified-documents/">to trial</a> (though not until next year) and everyone, unbelievably, is waiting for another couple indictments to drop. Which brings us to today...
  todays: 
  - item: While everyone was waiting on special counsel Jack Smith to announce a potential indictment in his election interference investigation (more on that in a second), the federal prosecutor zigged instead of zagged and released a 60-page superseding indictment that added new charges—and a whole new defendant—to the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Sure, why not.

  - item: The charges stem from a new detail in the unsealed indictment&#x3a; that Trump, Walt Nauta (who was charged the same day as Trump), and Carlos De Oliveira (more on him below) asked <i>another</i> Mar-a-Lago employee to "delete security camera footage at the Mar-a-Lago Club to prevent the footage from being provided to a federal grand jury." <i>Whoops</i>. All three now face three new charges around this attempt to "alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal evidence."

  - item: The new defendant is Carlos De Oliveira, a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago, who assisted Walt Nauta, Trump's Diet Coke valet, in playing wack-a-mole with document boxes around the resort. De Oliveira is also quoted in the indictment as telling an IT worker at Mar-a-Lago that "the boss" wanted security footage deleted. The IT worker told him that he didn't believe he "had the right to do that."

  - item: Meanwhile, <i>and also today</i>, Trump's lawyers met with Jack Smith on his investigation into Trump's attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, yet another sign (after last week's target letter) that an indictment is potentially very close. The grand jury hearing evidence in the investigation did meet in Washington DC today, though obviously no indictments were returned. According to CNN, Trump's lawyers were not given "any guidance about timing of a possible indictment," so you know, let's just continue to wait (it's going to drop soon isn't it).

  - item: Also, in case you thought that maybe this was enough for one day, don't forget that we're now in the window of time that Georgia DA Fani Willis has said that <i>her</i> potential indictment of Trump for meddling in Georgia's election results might drop. In fact, according to the Atlanta News First "Security barriers were spotted going up Thursday outside the Fulton County courthouse." I'm sure it's nothing.

  yesterday: On Thursday, June 8th, Donald Trump was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/08/trump-classified-documents-mar-a-lago/">indicted on 37 federal counts</a> stemming from his refusal to return classified documents to the National Archives. On Tuesday June 13th, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/us/politics/trump-indictment-2024-campaign.html">arraigned in the courtroom of Judge Aileen Cannon</a> where he pled not guilty on all counts and on June 20th, Judge Cannon <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/politics/trump-federal-trial-date/index.html">set the trial date for August 14th</a>, which only held up until today...
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Trump's trial date in the classified documents case has been, as expected, pushed back</b> from its original start date of the rapidly-approaching August 14th. Prior to Judge Aileen Cannon's decision today, federal prosecutors had asked for a delay until December of this year, while Trump's defense wanted an indefinite delay until after the 2024 election. <b>Judge Cannon split the difference and set the trial to start on or around May 20, 2024</b>. The new date falls near the end of the Republican primary calendar, which means Trump could have sewn up the nomination by then and would stand trial as the party's presumptive nominee. That is, if the date holds (or, I guess, if he isn't the nominee). There are still plenty of pretrial motions to come and the possibility that some of those will further delay the trial is very real.

  - item: <b>The May 20th trial date means that Trump will first stand trial on the criminal charges he faces in New York State, which is set for March 25, 2024</b>. These two trials join a stacked calendar for Trump, who also faces a civil trial for fraud against the Trump Organization which is set for October 2nd of this year, and a second defamation suit from E Jean Carroll which goes to trial on January 15th (because neither of these trials are criminal trials, I won't be covering them in detail).  Not to mention a Republican primary calendar that sees its first votes cast in mid-January.

  - item: And then there's the very real possibility of still more indictments to come. First, the one we've known about, Fulton County district attorney Fani T Willis's investigation into Trump and his associates' attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. <b>Indictments are expected to drop in Willis's investigation sometime in the first few weeks of August</b>. As opposed to the New York case, which only charged Trump, or the federal charges which are against Trump and a single aide, almost 20 people have been warned by Willis that they are targets of the investigation and could face charges. When those finally hit, it's going to be <i>something</i>.

  - item: Finally, did someone say "target"? That brings us to the <i>second</i> indictment (potentially) still to come. <b>Earlier this week Trump disclosed that he had received a target letter from federal special counsel Jack Smith who, in addition to leading the investigation on the Mar-a-Lago documents case, is also heading up the investigation into the myriad of shenanigans around January 6</b>. That investigation, which has been ongoing for years, appears to be coming to a close and it now seems that another federal indictment of Trump is likely.

  yesterday: On Thursday, June 8th, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/08/trump-classified-documents-mar-a-lago/">was indicted on 37 federal counts</a> stemming from his refusal to return classified documents to the National Archives. This made him the first president to ever be charged with a federal crime, and is now his <i>second</i> indictment of the year, having been <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23741583-the-people-of-the-state-of-new-york-v-donald-j-trump">indicted on March 30th in New York State</a> for falsifying business records around a hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. On Tuesday June 13th, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/us/politics/trump-indictment-2024-campaign.html">he was arraigned</a> in the courtroom of Judge Aileen Cannon where he pled not guilty on all counts. No trial date was set, until today...
  todays: 
  - item: One week to the day after the arraignment of Donald Trump on federal charges for mishandling classified documents, Judge Aileen Cannon has set a tentative date for the trial to begin and… it's in less than two months! <b>Judge Cannon set August 14th for the trial's start, with pretrial motions due by July 24th</b>. However, in her written order, she did note that "modifications" can be made "as this matter proceeds." Pretty much every expert expects those modifications to happen and, personally, they better because August 14 is two days before I send my kid off to college. Hahahaha. <i>Cries</i>.
    source: CNN
    url: https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/politics/trump-federal-trial-date/index.html
  - item: <b>Pushing back the trial date will likely be necessary due to the complexities of a trial involving classified documents which will need to follow the strict rules of the Classified Information Procedures Act.</b> According to the Washington Post, the law "created a series of pretrial steps that must be taken to decide exactly what classified information will be used in court, and how." First off, at least one of Trump's lawyers needs to get security clearance, which can take weeks at best and easily stretch to months (not to mention, he still hasn't finalized his legal team). Then, all documents shared with the defense in the discovery phase need to be handled in a SCIF, a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility—no copies made, no digital versions on a laptop. Even <i>discussions</i> about the documents need to happen in a SCIF. And <i>then</i>, once all documents have been shared, the defense lawyers have to create a secure document outlining what classified information they'd like to disclose to jurors. Prosecutors can object to those plans. In fact, every step along the way is an open door for litigation. And, somehow  all of this will happen in the next two months, with a presiding judge who has never overseen a classified documents case either. It doesn't seem likely.

  tomorrow: Well, I for one will be watching for the first motions to push back the trial. <i>Because I really need it to be pushed back</i>. Also, Trump's shambolic defense team will probably become a little less raggedy. Oh, also there's the very distinct possibility that we're about six weeks away from an indictment in Georgia. Hot indictment summer rolls on apace.
- date: 2023-06-15T18:15:00
  yesterday: On January 20, 2021, Donald Trump left the White House. In what most described as a hurried and chaotic move, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-departed-white-house-aides-rushed-pack-documents-2022-09-07/">dozens of boxes</a> of presidential papers were moved to Mar-a-Lago, Trump's home and private club in Florida. A few months later, the National Archives requested the return of the papers, which are federal property. The National Archives then spent much of the next year continuing to ask for the return of these papers. Finally, in January of 2022, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/07/trump-records-mar-a-lago/">Trump returned 15 boxes</a>, which were discovered to contain 197 classified documents, at which point the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/09/trump-archives-justice-department/">National Archives alerted the Justice Department</a> and the FBI opened an investigation. Cut to August 8, 2022 when the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-lago-search-warrant-fbi-donald-trump/index.html">FBI executed a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago</a> where they found many more classified documents and their investigation intensified. Which brings us to toda… last week.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>On Thursday, June 8th, Donald Trump was indicted on 37 federal counts stemming from his refusal to return classified documents to the National Archives</b>. The charges include willful retention of national defense secrets, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy. If he's convicted, he could face years of prison time. Of the 37 counts, 31 are for violations of the Espionage Act, which, *whistles*. The federal indictment comes just two and a half months after he was indicted on state charges in New York and makes him not only the first president to be indicted on federal charges, but the first to become indicted for anything <i>twice</i>. The indictment was announced by Trump himself who took to his social network Truth Social to announce, "I have been indicted, seemingly over the Boxes Hoax," which doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but so it goes.

  - item: <b>The 49-page indictment was unsealed the next day by special council Jack Smith. The entire document is stunning, filled with example after example of Trump's cavalier attitude towards dozens of boxes that contained hundreds of classified files.</b> The indictment demonstrates not only the unsecured storage of the files, including photographs of boxes stored on a ballroom stage and crammed into a bathroom, surrounding a toilet, but is also filled with direct quotes from Trump and his aides, through texts, notes, and actual full-on audio recordings. When meeting with a lawyer about turning over files to the FBI, Trump tells one of his lawyers "if there’s anything really bad" in the files, "pluck it out." In a recorded conversation, Trump shows a reporter at his Bedminster New Jersey golf club a military invasion plan he describes as "highly confidential," and admits that he "could have declassified it" as president, but "now I can't." Which, well, *stares*. The whole indictment is equal parts entertaining and disturbing.

  - item: <b>Also charged alongside Donald Trump was Walt Nauta, a former Navy petty officer who is now a personal valet for Trump after serving the important role in the White House of being the person on the other side of the president's Diet Coke button.</b> No, <i>really</i>. Nauta has been charged with six counts including conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements and representations. The indictment is filled with texts and pictures from Nauta, who appeared to be the former president's chief box wrangler. The government alleges that Nauta was ordered by Trump "to move boxes of documents to conceal them from Trump's attorney, the FBI, and the grand jury" and that he "hid, concealed, and covered up from the FBI Trump's continued possession of documents with classification margins at the Mar-a-Lago Club."

  - item: <b>The judge assigned to the case is Aileen M Cannon</b>, who was appointed by Trump and confirmed in November 2020, after he had lost the election. Cannon had no prior experience as a judge before her appointment and, according to the New York Times, has only presided over four criminal trials since then. "In all," the Times writes, "the four cases added up to 14 trial days." Judge Cannon did, however, preside over the brief lawsuit from Donald Trump requesting the appointment of a special master to review the very documents at the center of this indictment. Cannon granted Trump's request, but her decision was overturned and the case dismissed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals who found that Cannon had "improperly exercised equitable jurisdiction" over it.  While Cannon could recuse herself, or special council Jack Smith could request she do so, the Times reports, "there is no sign that either of them is considering taking that step."

  - item: Finally, <b>on Tuesday, June 13th, Trump was booked and arraigned in the federal courthouse in Miami</b>, having traveled down from Bedminster, NJ the day before. "Trump appeared frustrated as he sat at the defense table, frowning with his arms crossed," according to the Guardian. The New York Times described it as "a humiliating moment." <b>He pled not guilty to all charges.</b> Following the arraignment, he traveled to the Versailles coffee shop in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood where he bought food for supporters, then picked up McDonalds for his flight back to New Jersey where he gave a speech and if you think I watched it you are crazy. The next day, June 14th, was his 77th birthday. Happy Birthday.

  - item: So what happens now? <b>Special council Jack Smith has said he wants a "speedy trial"</b> which in the Southern Florida district could mean as soon as 70 days after the arraignment, or August 22nd, <i>the day before the first Republican primary debate</i>. However, most experts agree that it will take much longer than that. Trump's team will want to slow the case to a crawl and are expected to unleash a "flurry of motions and challenges to delay" the trial, according to Axios. As of now, there's no schedule set for when those motions and challenges will begin. The only date currently known is June 27th, when Walt Nauta will enter his plea (he did not have a local lawyer, so his plea was delayed, though he did appear with Trump at the arraignment).

And in the New York trial, Trump's defense has until August 29th to file any motions. Plus, you know, there's also a Jack Smith-run federal investigation into Trump's involvement in 2020 election hijinks and the January 6th insurrection that is still moving forward. <i>Wheeeeee</i>.

  yesterday: On April 4, 2023, former president Donald Trump <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23741583-the-people-of-the-state-of-new-york-v-donald-j-trump">was charged with 34 felony counts</a> of falsifying business records, marking the first time in history a US president has ever been charged with a crime. The charges stem from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/21/trump-stormy-payments/">a hush money payment</a> made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the last few weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign and center around the falsifying of business records related to the reimbursement of Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen who facilitated the payment. Specifically, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleges that the records were falsified with the <a href="https://www.npr.org/live-updates/trump-indictment-arraignment-arrest-new-york#trumps-felony-charges-hinge-on-the-intent-to-commit-or-conceal-other-crimes">"intent to commit another crime and aid in the conceal the commission thereof."</a>
  todays: 
  - item: There's officially a date for the trial of Donald Trump and it's... not for a while. At a hearing today, Justice Juan Merchan set the trial's start date for March 25, 2024. Yes, Twenty <i>Twenty-Four</i>, otherwise known as <i>next year</i>. Trump joined the proceedings remotely and, according to the New York Times, "when Justice Merchan mentioned the trial date, he immediately grew agitated, chattering at [his lawyer] ... waving his hands and shaking his head." Which, honestly, <i>me too</i>. In addition to the far-off trial date, the judge set the timeline for the rest of the year. The defense has until August 29th to file any motions—almost certainly they will file a motion to dismiss—and the prosecution has until October 10th to respond. The judge won't rule on the motions until January 4th. Hope you all like waiting!

  - item: At the hearing, which only lasted about 20 minutes, Justice Merchan also reviewed an order that dictates what Trump can and can't talk about in relation to the evidence against him that prosecutors will turn over to the defense during discovery. The order explicitly forbids the dissemination of discovery materials on social media. When his lawyer pushed back on the order, explaining that Trump was a presidential candidate, Justice Merchan responded that it was not his "intention to impede Mr. Trump's ability to campaign," and that he's free to deny the charges, "free to do almost anything not covered in the protective order." That said, if Trump disobeys the order and, oh you know, goes blabbing on Truth Social, Justice Merchan reiterated that there were a "wide range of possible sanctions including a finding of contempt."

  - item: Finally, while it will be a <i>long</i> while before Trump's trial (that is, if this schedule holds), there's <i>another</i> potential indictment that's rapidly approaching. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who has been investigating Trump's potential interference in the 2020 presidential election in the state, last week informed judges to "not schedule trials and in person hearings during the weeks beginning Monday, August 7 and Monday, August 14" and told her staff to plan on working from home from July 31 to August 18. It is widely believed that this is because she'll be announcing indictments in her investigation, which could well include Donald Trump.

  yesterday: On March 30th, former president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/30/trump-ny-indictment/">Donald Trump was indicted</a> by a Manhattan grand jury impaneled by New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Until today, however, we haven't known the specifics of the charges against him. Now we do...
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Donald Trump has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records</b>, marking the first time a US president has ever been charged with a crime. The large number of charges is due to each business record—we're talking check stubs, invoices, and accounting ledger entries—receiving its own count. The business records date back to 2017 and appear to all relate to the $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels by Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen and his subsequent reimbursement by the Trump Organization. The counts are nearly identical, each alleging that the records were falsified with "intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof." This part is crucial, because falsifying business records is only a misdemeanor in New York. To qualify as a felony, the falsifying needs to have been done in service of committing or concealing another crime. More on that in a second.

  - item: <b>Accompanying the charges was a Statement of Fact that built a larger narrative around the case than the narrow charges offered</b>. In it, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg outlined a "scheme" Trump hatched "with others," including Michael Cohen and former American Media Inc CEO David Pecker, to purchase "negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the Defendant's electoral prospects." Bragg cited hush money payments made not only to Stormy Daniels, but also to a Trump Tower doorman and another woman. While the Statement of Fact outlines what amounts to a conspiracy between Trump, Cohen, Pecker, and others, it is important to note that conspiracy was not charged today, only falsifying business records.

  - item: So OK that's all good, but no conspiracy was charged and falsifying business records on its own isn't a felony, <b>so what <i>were</i> the crimes that these business records were falsified to conceal?</b> At a press conference this afternoon, DA Bragg explained that, while the law does not require the charges to include that information, <b>the potential crimes include violations of New York State election law, which Bragg said "makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means," making false statements in misrepresenting things like the reimbursement of Michael Cohen to tax authorities as legal expenses, and breaking federal election law, which limits the total amount that can be donated to a campaign.</b>

  - item: The charges were unsealed as part of <b>Trump's Big Day at the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, where he was arrested, booked, and fingerprinted on the 7th floor (no mugshot was taken, sorry) and then arraigned in the courtroom of state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan on the 15th floor</b>, where he plead not guilty to the 34 counts against him. Cameras were everywhere, following by air as his motorcade left Trump Tower and drove down Manhattan, perched on street corners as the entourage drove by, waiting in the hallway of the 15th floor—framed on a set of black double doors that Trump eventually walked through, looking dour, before entering the courtroom—and waiting from a distance at LaGuardia for Trump's quick exit from New York after the arraignment wrapped. Before the whole whirlwind began, en route to the Criminal Courts Building, Trump posted to Truth Social that it was "SURREAL" and, honestly, it really was.

Despite the high-profile nature of the defendant, this <i>is</i> a criminal trial in the New York court system and things will move at a very deliberate pace. <b>The next procedural hearing is scheduled for December 4th</b>—yes, you read that right—and, if the case is not dismissed at that hearing (which Trump's attorneys are certain to request) a trial won't happen until sometime next year. <b>In the near term, the next thing that will happen is the discovery phase</b>, where prosecutors will turn over the evidence they have amassed to the defense. After that point, which might take a month or two, Merchan says he will decide on a trial date.

The indictment is sealed until tomorrow's arraignment, but it is believed to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/21/trump-stormy-payments/">pertain to hush-money payments</a> made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016 and the potential falsifying of business records connected to the payment.

  - item: Well, he didn't flee. <b>Donald Trump arrived in New York this afternoon</b> after departing Mar-a-Lago in an 11-car entourage that was followed to the airport by news helicopters, OJ-Bronco-style. He was accompanied on the flight by more than a dozen aides as well as his son Eric. Trump arrived at a heavily-secured Trump Tower around 4:30 Eastern, where he waved at the assembled press and a crowd of his supporters before entering the building, where he'll be staying the night before his big day tomorrow.

Appearing on the TODAY show this morning, Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopino said emphatically that Trump would turn himself in to authorities and that he was "not going to hole up in Mar-a-Lago." The current belief is that Trump will fly into New York on Monday and stay the night at Trump Tower before heading to the Manhattan DA's office in the morning to turn himself in, at which point he will be booked, fingerprinted, and photographed. (Yes, if there's a mugshot, <i>of course</i> it'll be included in the update, <i>I mean come on</i>.)

  tomorrow: All attention turns to Tuesday, April 4, when Donald Trump will be arrested, booked, and arraigned. Of course, that date might change, it's all still being negotiated. 

- date: 2023-03-30T16:10:00
  yesterday: Let's catch you up on 16 years real quick. In 2006, then-reality TV star Donald Trump met adult film star Stormy Daniels <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/who-is-stormy-daniels-what-did-she-say-happened-with-trump-2023-03-30/">at a celebrity golf tournament</a> where Daniels slept with Trump in what she would later call "<a href="https://people.com/politics/stormy-daniels-book-donald-trump-least-impressive-sex/">the least impressive sex I ever had</a>." Flash forward to 2016, Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president and Stormy Daniels is shopping her story to tabloids, but instead it's bought, for $130,000, in a hush-money purchase facilitated by Trump's lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen himself took out a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/politics/michael-cohen-trump-organization-email-stormy-daniels/index.html">home equity line of credit</a> to cover the payment, wired to Daniels 10 days before the 2016 Presidential election and was later paid back over numerous installments by the Trump Organization. Flash forward to 2018, when <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-crime-d6dbb8b02a4446f6800de794b45523e6">Michael Cohen is arrested</a> for tax evasion, lying to investigators about Trump's businesses in Russia and—most important for this moment in time—violating campaign finance laws for that $130,000 payment to Daniels, which federal prosecutors argued was a illegal contribution to Trump's campaign. Cohen later plead guilty, meaning that the case was never taken to trial, and served a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-crime-new-york-manhattan-campaigns-3a0413202e80ab99c9f6377f97d07c04">three year sentence</a>, most of which was spent in home confinement due to the pandemic. Almost immediately after Cohen's guilty plea, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance began to investigate the hush-money payments at the state level, eventually widening the scope to include the Trump Organization's business practices. Vance's investigations eventually lead to the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html">Trump Organization being found guilty</a> of tax fraud and falsifying business records. His investigation of the Daniels payments, however, seemed fade into the background and, eventually, when new Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg took over in January 2022, it was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/17/alvin-bragg-stormy-daniels-trump/">reported to be a "zombie" case</a> that most presumed to all but dead. That is until January of this year when Bragg convened a new grand jury to once again investigate the payment of hush money to Daniels, which brings us to today...
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury. He becomes the first president in US history to ever be charged with a crime.</b> According to the Washington Post, "the indictment was filed behind closed doors at the Lower Manhattan courthouse after the clerk’s office was closed for the day," and comes about two months after Bragg impaneled a grand jury to investigate the circumstances around the 2016 payment by Trump to adult star Stormy Daniels which previously lead to the 2018 conviction of his former lawyer Michael Cohen. There's a <i>long</i> way to go from here, but this moment is truly unprecedented.

  - item: So what are the charges? As of now we don't know. <b>Grand jury proceedings are secret and the indictment is sealed until a judge unseals it at an arraignment. What we <i>do</i> know is that the charges will almost certainly focus on the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels and the falsifying of business records that came afterwards.</b> Now, paying hush money isn't illegal, and falsifying business records is usually a misdemeanor offense, and this seems like it would be <i>a whole lot of effort</i> if that's where it stopped. But the real question is whether or not those business records were falsified to conceal another crime, like, say, campaign finance violations, at which point the crime could be prosecuted as a felony offense. According to the Wall Street Journal, "any successful prosecution would likely require evidence establishing that Mr. Trump tried to hide the repayment to Mr. Cohen with false book entries" and that those entries were made with an "intent to defraud." Of course, we'll know much more soon.

While it's not expected that Trump will resist arrest (<i>can you imagine???</i>), Florida Governor Ron DeSantis did Tweet that law enforcement would "not assist in an extradition request." It likely won't come to that, however, and the current expectation is that Trump will surrender next week, possibly Tuesday.

  - item: Now it's important to remember that there's a <i>long</i> way between an indictment and a conviction, and that a conviction of Donald Trump is by no means guaranteed. One thing that <i>is</i> guaranteed is, barring a guilty plea by Trump (which, <i>stares</i>), this process will be brutally slow. According Reuters, <b>the "average criminal case in New York takes more than a year to move from indictment to trial" and this case is anything but average.</b> Which could mean that <i>if</i> a trial happens at all it could happen during the last months of the 2024 presidential race or, very possibly, after.

  tomorrow: At some point in the next week Donald Trump will be arrested and processed (complete with mug shot and fingerprints). Shortly after his arrest, he will have an arraignment hearing at which point we'll know the charges against him and he will plead guilty or not guilty (guess which) and then the legal maneuvering will truly begin.
